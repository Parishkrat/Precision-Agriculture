    <h1>Exploring Data Driven Precision Agriculture</h1>
     <p>
       Big data and mobile technology are widely claimed to be global disruptive forces in agriculture that benefit small-scale farmers. Yet the access of small-scale farmers to this technology is poorly understood. We show that only 24–37% of farms of " ha in size are served by third generation (3G) or 4G services, compared to 74–80% of farms of "200 ha in size. 
        Furthermore, croplands with severe yield gaps, climate-stressed locations and food-insecure populations have poor service coverage. Across many countries in Africa, less than ~40% of farming households have Internet access, and the cost of data remains prohibitive. We recommend a digital inclusion agenda whereby governments, the development community and the private sector focus their efforts to improve access so that data-driven agriculture is available to all farmers globally.</p>

            Data-driven interventions are widely suggested to be a disruptive force in global food systems1,2,3,4,5. The aim is to use big data and mobile technology to address issues as diverse as low crop yields6, poor human nutrition7, disease8 and climate adaptation1. However, mobile network coverage, handset ownership and affordable mobile service subscriptions are necessary prerequisites to achieve these solutions. Although the footprints of mobile networks and mobile phone ownership have increased in recent years, and the costs of mobile data have declined9, substantial gaps in access remain. Nearly half of the world’s population is estimated to still be without Internet access10. There is concern that this digital divide could stall the realization of human rights11 and the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations (UN), particularly those relating to education, equity, health and well-being12.

We define data-driven farming as the use of data to augment decision-making in farming systems and thus improve food system outcomes such as crop yields, profits, environmental sustainability and food security. The potential for data-driven farming to improve food systems has recently expanded due to advances in three key areas: data generation (for example, in mobile devices, field sensors, satellites and ‘farmers as sensors’), data processing and predictive analytics (for example, by using big data stacks, machine learning and deep learning), and human–computer interactions (that is, human-centric approaches to create experiences that improve the ease and use of insights through voice, text and images). Data-driven farming is promoted in areas such as climate services13, digital extension14, precision agriculture3, market information systems15 and agricultural insurance2. There are many specific examples, including the IBM Watson Decision Platform for Agriculture, which uses performance geocomputation and a range of input data, such as high-resolution weather forecasts, for localized prescription farming and crop management16. Another example is the Nuru application of the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, which uses computer vision for in-field pest and disease diagnostics of major food security threats such as the damage caused by the fall armyworm17.

Recent synthesis has estimated that mobile-phone-based digital extension and price information systems in sub-Saharan Africa and India, some of which are data-driven, can modestly improve crop yields, increase adoption of recommended inputs, and raise farmer profits14. Basic benefits of the use of mobile technologies have also been reported in healthcare; for example, where improvements in patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs have been documented18. However, it is poorly understood how the differential access to mobile technologies in farming communities might limit the vision for achieving data-driven farming, health and nutrition globally19. In particular, donors, governments and research organizations lack sufficient understanding of the spatial distribution of data services across farms, and how existing services intersect with farms that have the greatest need for support and areas which contain the most food-insecure populations20. This lack of understanding of the baseline for data-driven farming limits our ability to assess the feasibility, scalability and probable impact of investment in digital technology projects and interventions in food systems across the world.

Here, we report a global baseline assessment of the state of mobile coverage and access to data services in farming. We use the coverage of mobile services as a measure of availability, which is the basic infrastructural backbone needed for scaling data-driven solutions. We examine how this availability intersects with opportunities for raising productivity and delivering financial, climate and healthcare services. We then assess subnational patterns in mobile phone and Internet access across non-farming and farming populations, for a subset of countries for which subnational data are available. In these countries are found 75%, 88% and 46% of all farming households in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Asia, respectively. We consider our results within the context of the current needs for closing the digital divide in agriculture on a global scale.

<h4 class="word lol" id="aword">How is data used in agriculture?</h4>
<p>
    While precision agriculture produces lots of data, extracting useful insights out of this data is a complicated task. For example, the role of nitrogen fertilizer, water and herbicide on yield is known and pretty much established. Having all other factors unchanged, we can find the optimum amount of each to maximize the yield.

    <li>Precision Nutrition: application of nutrients on requirement basis helps reduce costs and together with precision irrigation, it prevents the runoff of nutrients(fertilizers). Fertilizers are not always evenly distributed throughout the fields.</li>

(The inputs here will be from the farmer. This allows the farmer to prioritise a section of the farm for alerts.)

<h2>What about the sensors and the data?</h2>
<p>We will be using dummy data# for now to test our project.
We plan to buy some sensors and already have a Raspberry Pi(3B) to further expand our project, if time permits*.
This project is interdisciplinary, and there is a possibility of working with other departments later, as we continue the project.
